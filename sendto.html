    <h3>Hello Mom, this is Robert. If you can't already tell, this is your present, as it says in the subject. <br >I know that I might not have given you the best present in the world, such as me writing a song, but this is something that I can give you. Something for all of our hard work in getting me into specific places, internships, etc. <br >This might be hard to read, but this is because I spent over 4 hours working on this, and this is the product that I ended up coming up with. Anyways, without further ado, here is my product. <br > <br > <br >Tada!<br >Turns out that creating something in programming takes much longer than you would expect, after all, this did take over 4 hours to create such a mediocre thing.<br >Anyways, I wanted to make sure that you understood that I care for you, and that literally everything that I do, along with trying to make me happy, I try to make you happy with also. I want to see your approval when I am trying something new, it makes me thrive. <br >I honestly just want to wish you a happy birthday, and leave you with the fact that I love you very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very much, even more than you love me. <br >Anyways, I should get going, I have school to attend! <br >Love you mom and have a great and happy birthday! <br >- Love your son, Robert.</h3>
