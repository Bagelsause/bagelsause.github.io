I know that I might not have given you the best present in the world, such as me writing a song, but this is something that I can give you. Something for all of our hard work in getting me into specific places, internships, etc. This might be hard to read, but this is because I spent over 4 hours working on this, and this is the product that I ended up coming up with. Anyways, without further ado, here is my product. Tada! Turns out that creating something in programming takes much longer than you would expect, after all, this did take over 4 hours to create such a mediocre thing. Anyways, I wanted to make sure that you understood that I care for you, and that literally everything that I do, along with trying to make me happy, I try to make you happy with also. I want to see your approval when I am trying something new, it makes me thrive. I honestly just want to wish you a happy birthday, and leave you with the fact that I love you very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very much, even more than you love me. Anyways, I should get going, I have school to attend! Love you mom and have a great and happy birthday! - Love your son, Robert."
